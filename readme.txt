isure i can leave a light on
let it shine on
leave it till dawn

staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day you'll make a dream last

the truth that you leave

jam july

one morning lst july
down  green came a sweet cilin

he smile at me and he says's 
that's the gem of ireland's crown

creating a new branck is quick & simple
